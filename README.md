# Fidelio

Forces secure connections and secure cookies on sites specified by the user in the options page.

By default twitter.com and facebook.com are enabled.

The method used means that there is no cookie leak in the initial HTTP request, since cookies are re-written with the secure flag set.

This means that when you first enable the extension, on some sites you will need to re-login.
